            Before participating at the Olympic Games Paris 2024, the Under-23 Morocco side had never even made it out of the football group stages before.

            But here in Europe, they broke new ground and rewrote the history books.
            
            While their quest for gold was stunted in a semi-final defeat by Spain, the African nation still had a chance at making the podium.
            
            And that is exactly what they did, winning a first-ever Olympic medal in style as they picked apart Egypt in a thumping 6-0 victory.
            
            Abde Ezzalzouli opened the scoring just after the 20-minute mark before Soufiane Rahimi doubled their advantage just moments later with his seventh goal of the tournament.
            
            Bilal El Khannouss added a third soon after the interval before Rahimi completed his brace.
            
            And just in case there was any doubt, a fifth from Akram Nakach sealed their place on the podium late on.
            
            Morocco captain Achraf Hakimi wanted in on the action too, curling home a pinpoint free-kick to emphasise just how thrilling this side have been.
            
            Morocco is very much a nation on the rise, and this emphatic bronze is just the start for them</h5></p>
